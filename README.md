# Stomping Grounds
## An e-commerce app targeted towards selling high end boots and outdoor shoes.

### Eric Van Meter, Mark Jenquine, Vikram Sharma

Stomping grounds is a full CRUD application designed to display our skills with:
- Using *Node/Express* to create a back-end server
- Creating a database of JSON objects with *Mongoose and MongoDB*
- Developing a front-end application to interact with and display our data with *React and React Router*.

Starting from our initial wire frame, the three of us split off to work on individual site components. We collaborated to debug and deploy both the API and React app to Heroku.
